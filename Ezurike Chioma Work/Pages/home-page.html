These specialized skills can help you in your career as a UI or UX designer, design lead or creative director.
    <p><b>8. Data analytics</b></p>
    Data analytics involves the process of storing, managing and using data to gain valuable information and insights. Jobs that use data analytics skills include business intelligence analysts, data analysts, data engineers, data analytics consultants and IT systems analysts.
    <p><b>9. Data science</b></p>
    Data science is multi-faceted, combining two or more academic disciplines, such as math, statistics, visualization, advanced computing, domain expertise, scientific method and data engineering. The practice of data science incorporates data mining, machine learning and big data and involves scientific methods, processes and algorithms to discover insightful ways to interpret and use structured and unstructured data. Data science skills can help you in a career as a data scientist, machine learning engineer, enterprise architect and statistician.
    <p><b>10. Programming</b></p>
    Programming uses a formal language to essentially tell a computer what to do or how to solve problems. Without programming, computers are unable to perform tasks of any kind. Jobs that use computer programming skills include computer systems engineers, business intelligence analysts, software application developers, database administrators and software quality assurance (QA) engineers.
    <p><b>11. Computer graphics</b></p>
    Computer graphics is the act of creating or manipulating digital images in the form of pixels drawn on a computer. Computer graphics skills are useful in UI design, animation, web design, video editing and graphic design.
    <p><b>12. Digital marketing</b></p>
    Digital marketing is advertising using digital technologies, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones and other digital platforms. It's the act of using digital media channels, such as search engines, websites, email, social media and apps to deliver information and promote products, services and brands. Jobs that use digital marketing skills include content managers and strategists, SEO and SEM specialists, virtual reality developers, digital marketing managers and email marketing specialists.
    <p><b>13. Mobile development</p></b>
    Mobile development involves development for mobile devices, such as building mobile applications. Understanding programming languages, such as HTML and CSS, is also an important part of working as a mobile developer. Other jobs that use mobile development skills include mobile software project coordinators and IOS developers.
    <p><b>14. Virtualization</b></p>
